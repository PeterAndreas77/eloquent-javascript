We looked at four types of JavaScript values in this chapter: numbers, strings, Booleans,
and undefined values.

Such values are created by typing in their name (true, null) or value (13, "abc"). You can
combine and transform values with operators. We saw binary operators for arithmetic (+, -,
*, /, and %), string concatenation (+), comparison (==, !=, ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=), and
logic (&&, ||), as well as several unary operators (- to negate a number, ! to negate
logically, and typeof to find a valueâ€™s type) and a ternary operator (?:) to pick one of
two values based on a third value.
