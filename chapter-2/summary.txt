You now know that a program is built out of statements, which themselves sometimes contain
more statements. Statements tend to contain expressions, which themselves can be built out
of smaller expressions.

Putting statements after one another gives you a program that is executed from top to bottom.
You can introduce disturbances in the flow of control by using conditional (if, else, and
switch) and looping (while, do, and for) statements.

Bindings can be used to file pieces of data under a name, and they are useful for tracking
state in your program. The environment is the set of bindings that are defined. JavaScript
systems always put a number of useful standard bindings into your environment.

Functions are special values that encapsulate a piece of program. You can invoke them by
writing functionName(argument1, argument2). Such a function call is an expression and may
produce a value.
